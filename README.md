# SquadUp
## A group decision making progressive web app

# SquadUp

Squad Assemble! 

SquadUp is a group decision making progressive web app that helps large groups decide where to eat at, which travel destinations to go to, and allows for bill
splitting among group members. The application is designed for easy use and accessibility as only one group member needs to create an account and then a group code 
can be shared. As it is a progressive web app, SquadUp is accessible across all devices, does not take up storage space, and is straightforward and fast to use.
